# What's Next? 🚀

You've built and deployed 3 solid React apps. Here are some paths to level up your skills:

## 1. Upgrade to TypeScript 🛡️
Convert the projects (or just one) to **TypeScript**.
*   **Why?**: It's the #1 skill employers require for React roles.
*   **What**: Add types to props, state, and API responses.
*   **Difficulty**: Medium

## 2. Cloud-Power the Todo App ☁️
Currently, Todos live in your browser's `localStorage`. Let's connect them to **Firebase** (like Caffiend).
*   **Why?**: Real-world apps need backends.
*   **Features**: User Auth, Sync across devices (phone & laptop).
*   **Difficulty**: Medium

## 3. Automated Testing 🧪
Add **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**.
*   **Why?**: Professional codebases rely on tests to prevent bugs.
*   **What**: Write unit tests for your components (e.g., "Does the Todo delete button work?").
*   **Difficulty**: Medium

## 4. New Project: Weather Dashboard ☀️
Build a visually stunning weather app using a real API (OpenWeatherMap).
*   **Features**: Search cities, live weather, 5-day forecast, dynamic backgrounds.
*   **Difficulty**: Easy/Medium

## 5. New Project: Movie Database 🎬
Build an "IMDb Clone" using the TMDB API.
*   **Features**: Search movies, infinite scroll, favorites list, detailed info pages.
*   **Difficulty**: Medium
